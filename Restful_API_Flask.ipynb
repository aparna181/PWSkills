Blueprints make it easier to manage large applications by dividing them into manageable sections, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code. They also help in reusing code across different projects and simplify collaboration in team environments. By registering blueprints to the main application object, Flask combines all the components into a single, functional web application."

        "    -  One common method is using authentication and authorization, such as API keys, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or OAuth, to ensure only authorized users can access the API. Another important step is to use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt data during transmission. Input validation and sanitization are also essential to prevent injection attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). Additionally, enabling rate limiting helps protect the API from abuse or denial-of-service attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a certain time frame."

        "    - Flask-RESTful is an extension for Flask that simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs by providing useful tools and abstractions. It helps structure API endpoints using resource classes, making the code more organized and easier to maintain. Flask-RESTful automatically handles common tasks such as parsing request data, formatting responses, and managing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) through class-based views.This extension also supports built-in error handling, input validation, and integrates smoothly with Flask’s routing system. By reducing boilerplate code, Flask-RESTful allows developers to focus more on the application logic and less on repetitive tasks, speeding up API development and improving code clarity."
